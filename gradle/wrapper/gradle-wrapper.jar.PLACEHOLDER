PLACEHOLDER FILE

The gradle-wrapper.jar is a binary file that should be generated when you first
open the project in Android Studio or run ./gradlew for the first time.

If you need to manually download it:
1. Visit: https://gradle.org/releases/
2. Download Gradle 8.2
3. Extract gradle-wrapper.jar from the distribution
4. Place it in this directory: gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar

Alternatively, Android Studio will automatically download it when you open the project.
